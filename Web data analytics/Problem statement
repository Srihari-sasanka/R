Dataset Description:

The dataset from www.datadb.com contains the following variables for web analytics:
Bounces: Represents the percentage of visitors who leave the site without viewing other pages.
Continent: Indicates the continent from which the site is accessed.
Source Group: Shows how visitors have accessed the site.
Time on Page: Displays the duration users spend on specific pages.
Unique Pageview: Represents the number of sessions during which a page was viewed one or more times.
Visits: Counts all visitors, regardless of how many times the same visitor accesses the site.

Problem Statement:

The web analytics team aims to address the following issues:
Data Summarization: Analyze each variable in the dataset to gain a fundamental understanding and prepare for further analysis.
Unique Page Views vs. Visits: Investigate whether the unique page view value is dependent on the number of visits.
Exit Page Analysis: Identify probable factors from the dataset that could impact exits, distinct from bounces. Exit Page Analysis helps understand why users leave a website during a session.
Time on Page Factors: Determine variables in the dataset that potentially influence the time users spend on a page. Increasing this time enhances visitor engagement and the likelihood of transactions.
Bounce Rate Impact: Identify factors affecting the bounce rate, as a high bounce rate is concerning for websites reliant on visitor engagement.
